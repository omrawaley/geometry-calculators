# Calculators
A bunch of geometry-related calculators—surface area, volume, hypotenuse, etc—written in Java, Python, C#, C++, and Haskell.

Java, Python, C#, C++, and Haskell versions available in the `Java`, `Python`, `C#`, `C++`, and `Haskell` folders.

## For Java

`.jar` files are available in the `out > artifacts > _jar` folder.

Run `java -jar "path-to-jar"` in your command line!

## For Python

Executables available in the `exec` folder! (Created via [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/))

Run `python "path-to-py"` in your command line when using source code. Double click the executable or cd into the directory with the executable and run `./main` to run the executable!

Note: You may have to use either `python` or `python3` depending on your installed version of Python.

## For C#

Run `mono "path-to-Program.exe"` in your command line!

Note: Only tested on MacOS.

## For C++

Double click the executable (`calculator`) to run. You can alternatively `cd` into `CylinderCalculator` and run `./calculator` in your command line!

Makefile is included and to recompile, `cd` into `CylinderCalculator` and run `make -B calculator` in your command line after editing!

## For Haskell

Run `ghc Main.hs` to compile the program for your system.

Run `./Main` to run the executable.
